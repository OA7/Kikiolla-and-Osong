                <p> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                   with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                   equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
                    should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
                    the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                    itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                    than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                     and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                     Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
                    and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="p-links">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>  with 
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
                    space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="p-links">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently 
                    apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
                    Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                <p>
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, 
                    though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science 
                    comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, 
                    or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and 
                    energy to science and speculation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, 
                    is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, 
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe 
                    there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy 
                    eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                </p>

                <p> <q><b>As Big as It Gets</b></q></p>

                <p>
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at 
                    energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield 
                    new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                     observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
                     general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
