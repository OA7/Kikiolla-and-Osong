                <p> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                   with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                   equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
                    should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
                    the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                    itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                    than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                     and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                     Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
                    and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>

                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>  with 
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
                    space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently 
                    apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
                    Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
