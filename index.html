                <p> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
                   with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                   equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
                    should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
                    the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                    itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                    than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                     and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                     Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
                    and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="p-links">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>  with 
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
                    space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="p-links">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently 
                    apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
                    Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, 
                    though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science 
                    comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, 
                    or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and 
                    energy to science and speculation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, 
                    is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, 
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe 
                    there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy 
                    eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                </p>

                <p class="big-txt"> <q><b>As Big as It Gets</b></q></p>

                <p>
                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at 
                    energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield 
                    new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                     observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
                     general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, 
                    <q>This is huge, as big as it gets.</q>
                </p>

                <p>
                    He continued, <q>
                        This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
                    sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
                    radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it 
                    was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, 
                    for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their 
                    results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday 
                    and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                    Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such

                <p>
                    The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations 
                    and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of 
                    his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts 
                    Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his

                    but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did 
                    order it, 30 years ago,</q> Dr. Linde wrote in an email.

                    Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still 
                    hyperventilating. <q>Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,</q> he said.

                    By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been 
                    seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

                <p>
                    Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, <q>I think that if this stays 
                    true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing 
                    project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. 
                    <q>I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,</q> he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash 
                    of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would 
                    eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, 
                    noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic 
                    background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,</q> Dr. Krauss said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. 
                    At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, 
                    which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years 
                    ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. 
                    He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive 
                    radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. 
                    The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of 
                    Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                <p>
                    <q>The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,</q>
                    Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. 
                    <q>I’ve been hooked ever since,</q> he said.
